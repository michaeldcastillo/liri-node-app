# liri-node-app

### Project Description

This project takes its inspiration from Apple's Siri functionality, whereby information is requested via a non-visual interface...unlike a web browser or phone app. In this example, the app is executed via a command line interface (Node.js). The user supplies 2 command line values to the app (search context and search term) in order to retreive data via an API. The API that this app references belongs to Spotify, so the intent is to search for a song title and retrieve basic information related to that title, including a link to a preview audio file hosted with Spotify.
